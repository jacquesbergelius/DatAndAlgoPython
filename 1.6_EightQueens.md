# Eight Queens Problem

The **eight queens problem** is a classic combinatorial problem that involves placing eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. This means:

1. No two queens are in the same row.
2. No two queens are in the same column.
3. No two queens are on the same diagonal.

## Solution Using Recursion

A common approach to solving the eight queens problem is **backtracking**, a systematic way to iterate through all possible configurations. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

## Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Representation**: Use an 8×8 chessboard, which can be represented as a list of size 8. The index of the list represents the row, and the value at that index represents the column of the queen.

2. **Recursive Function**:
- Place one queen per row.
- For each row, try placing the queen in each column, checking if the position is valid (i.e., it doesn't conflict with already placed queens).
- If the position is valid, move to the next row (recursive step).
- If placing the queen in any column of a row fails, backtrack to the previous row and move the queen to the next possible column.

3. **Base Case**: If all queens are placed (i.e., you've placed queens in all rows), you've found a solution.

4. **Pruning**: At each step, avoid invalid configurations using a helper function to check whether a queen can be placed at a specific position.

## Python Code Implementation

Here’s how you can implement the solution in Python:

```python
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    """
    Check if a queen can be placed at board[row][col].
    """
    for i in range(row):
        # Check column conflict
        if board[i] == col:
            return False
        # Check diagonal conflicts
        if abs(board[i] - col) == abs(i - row):
            return False
    return True

def solve_n_queens(n, board=[], row=0):
    """
    Recursive function to solve the N-Queens problem.
    """
    if row == n:
        # All queens are placed successfully; print the solution
        print_solution(board)
        return True  # Return True to stop after finding one solution

    for col in range(n):
        if is_safe(board, row, col):
            # Place the queen
            board.append(col)
            # Recur to place the rest of the queens
            if solve_n_queens(n, board, row + 1):
                return True  # Stop after the first solution
            # Backtrack
            board.pop()
    return False  # No valid configuration found for this branch

def print_solution(board):
    """
    Print the board with queens placed.
    """
    n = len(board)
    for row in range(n):
        line = ["." for _ in range(n)]
        line[board[row]] = "Q"
        print("".join(line))
    print("\n")

# Solve the 8-Queens problem
solve_n_queens(8)
```

## Explanation of Code

1. **`is_safe`**:
- Checks whether placing a queen in the current column conflicts with any previously placed queens (in rows above).
- Checks column and diagonal conflicts.

2. **`solve_n_queens`**:
- Recursive function that tries to place queens row by row.
- If it reaches the base case (`row == n`), it prints a solution.

3. **`print_solution`**:
- Converts the `board` list into a visual chessboard with `Q` representing a queen and `.` representing an empty cell.

## Output

For \( n = 8 \), the program will print one solution:

```
Q.......  
...Q....  
.....Q..  
.......Q.  
..Q......  
.....Q...  
......Q..  
....Q....
```

You can modify the code to find all solutions by removing the `return True` in `solve_n_queens` and letting the recursion continue to explore all possible configurations.
