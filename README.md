# Supplement material to the Algorithms and Data Structures course in Python

This is supplement material to the Data Structures and Algorithms (TX00EY28) course

## Motivation

What every computer science major should know (http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/, Matt Might is an assistant Professor in University of Utah):
- Students should certainly see the common (or rare yet unreasonably effective) data structures and algorithms
- But, more important than knowing a specific algorithm or data structure (which is usually easy enough to look up), computer scientists must understand how to design algorithms (e.g., greedy, dynamic strategies) and how to span the gap between an algorithm in the ideal and the nitty-gritty of its implementation
- Specific recommendations
  - At a minimum, computer scientists seeking stable long-run employment should know all of the following:
    - hash tables
    - linked lists
    - trees
    - binary search trees, and
    - directed and undirected graphs
  - Computer scientists should be ready to implement or extend an algorithm that operates on these data structures, including the ability to search for an element, to add an element and to remove an element
