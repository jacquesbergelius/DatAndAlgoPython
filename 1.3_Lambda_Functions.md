# Python Lambda Functions

Lambda functions in Python are anonymous functions, meaning they are functions without a name. They are defined using the `lambda` keyword and can have any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are particularly useful when you need a simple function for a short period or when you want to pass a function as an argument to another function. Here's a tutorial on how to use lambda functions in Python:

## Basic Syntax:

The basic syntax of a lambda function in Python is:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

- `lambda`: The keyword used to create lambda functions.
- `arguments`: Comma-separated list of arguments (like the arguments of a regular function).
- `expression`: A single expression whose result is the return value of the function.

## Examples:

### 1. Simple lambda function:

```python
# Define a lambda function that adds two numbers
add = lambda x, y: x + y

# Call the lambda function
result = add(3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 7
```

### 2. Using lambda with built-in functions:

```python
# Sorting a list of tuples based on the second element
pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]
pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])
print(pairs)  # Output: [(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]
```

### 3. Lambda functions as arguments to higher-order functions:

```python
# Filtering a list using a lambda function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### 4. Using lambda functions with map():

```python
# Squaring each element of a list using a lambda function and map()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Limitations:

- Lambda functions are limited to a single expression, which means they are not suitable for complex logic.
- They can make code harder to understand if used excessively or inappropriately.

## When to Use Lambda Functions:

- For short, simple operations where defining a full function is unnecessary.
- As arguments to higher-order functions like `filter()`, `map()`, and `sort()`.

## Conclusion:

Lambda functions in Python provide a concise and convenient way to create small anonymous functions. While they have limitations, they can be quite handy in certain situations, especially when working with higher-order functions and simple operations. Practice using lambda functions to become comfortable with their syntax and applications.
