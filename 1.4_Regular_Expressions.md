# Regular Expressions in Python

Regular expressions (regex) in Python are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They allow you to search for and manipulate text using patterns, providing a flexible and efficient way to perform tasks such as searching, replacing, and validating strings based on patterns. Python provides a built-in module called `re` for working with regular expressions.

## Key Features of Regular Expressions:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions enable you to define complex patterns that describe sets of strings.

2. **Text Searching**: You can search for patterns within text strings, extracting or identifying specific substrings.

3. **Text Manipulation**: Regular expressions allow you to replace parts of strings, split strings based on patterns, and perform other text manipulation tasks.

## Basic Syntax:

To work with regular expressions in Python, you need to import the `re` module. Here's the basic syntax:

```python
import re

# Use re functions here...
```

## Main Functions in the `re` Module:

1. **`re.search(pattern, string)`**: Searches for the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.

2. **`re.match(pattern, string)`**: Matches the pattern only at the beginning of the string.

3. **`re.findall(pattern, string)`**: Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the string and returns them as a list.

4. **`re.finditer(pattern, string)`**: Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the string and returns an iterator of match objects.

5. **`re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`**: Substitutes occurrences of the pattern in the string with the replacement.

## Example Usage:

```python
import re

# Search for a pattern
result = re.search(r'apple', 'I like apples and oranges.')
print(result.group())  # Output: apple

# Find all occurrences of a pattern
matches = re.findall(r'\d+', 'The price is $10, and the discount is $5.')
print(matches)  # Output: ['10', '5']

# Substitute a pattern
new_string = re.sub(r'apple', 'banana', 'I like apples and oranges.')
print(new_string)  # Output: I like bananas and oranges.
```

## Special Characters in Regular Expressions:

- `.`: Matches any single character except newline.
- `^`: Matches the start of the string.
- `$`: Matches the end of the string.
- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character.
- `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character.
- `[]`: Matches any single character within the brackets.
- `|`: Matches either the pattern on its left or right.
- `()` : Groups patterns together.

## Conclusion:

Regular expressions in Python are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They provide a flexible and efficient way to work with strings based on patterns. Understanding regular expressions can greatly enhance your ability to work with text data in Python.
