## List Comprehensions

>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operation applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

List comprehension allows you to efficiently map a function over a list using elegant notation inspired by mathematical set theory. Let us first consider a (mathematical) set
```math
A = \{1, 3, 7 \}
```
Then
```math
B = \{ a^2 \ \vert \ a \in A \} = \{1, 9, 49 \}
```
describes a new set which is obtained by mapping the function $f(x) = x^2$ over the set $A$. In Python, you can use the syntax of list comprehension to do something completely analogous with lists. List comprehension in Python provides a concise way to create lists. They are a powerful and efficient construct that allows you to create new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list, tuple, set, etc.).

Let's convert this to Python
```python
A = [1, 3, 7]
```

Assume we want to map the square function $f(x) = x^2$ over this list. A slow and rather clumsy way to achieve this is by using a for-loop and the “append” command:
```python
B = []
for a in A:
    B.append(a**2)
# B = [1, 9, 49]
```
However, the exact same result can be generated using the following concise and elegant expression:
```python
B = [a**2 for a in A]
# B = [1, 9, 49]
```
Such expressions are called _list comprehensions_ in Python. The analogy to the set theory notation from above is obvious.

It is also possible to add a condition to the list comprehension. For example, if we want to map the square function over the list $A$ but only for the elements that are larger than 2, instead of this:
```python 
B = []
for a in A:
    if a > 2:
        B.append(a**2)
# B = [9, 49]
```

we can use the following list comprehension:
```python
B = [a**2 for a in A if a > 2]
# B = [9, 49]
```

### Basic Syntax:

The basic syntax of a list comprehension in Python is:

```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

- `expression`: The expression to evaluate for each item in the iterable.
- `item`: The variable representing each item in the iterable.
- `iterable`: The iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set) that you want to iterate over.
- `condition` (optional): An optional condition that filters items. Only items for which this condition evaluates to `True` will be included in the new list.

### Examples:

### 1. Square numbers from 0 to 9:

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

### 2. Filtering even numbers:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### 3. Flatten a 2D list:

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [item for sublist in matrix for item in sublist]
print(flattened)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### 4. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```python
celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]
fahrenheit = [(9/5) * temp + 32 for temp in celsius]
print(fahrenheit)  # Output: [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]
```

### Nested List Comprehensions:

You can also have nested list comprehensions for more complex scenarios:

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
transposed = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(3)]
print(transposed)  # Output: [[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]
```

### Benefits:

- **Conciseness**: List comprehensions are often more concise and readable than traditional for loops.
- **Efficiency**: They are also typically more efficient than traditional looping constructs in Python.


List comprehensions in Python are a powerful feature that allows you to create lists with concise and readable code. They are widely used in Python programming for their simplicity and efficiency. Practice using them to become proficient in leveraging their capabilities effectively.
