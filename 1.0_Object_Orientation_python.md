## Object-Orientation in Python

### Differences Between Java and Python Object-Oriented Models

Java and Python both support **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, but their approaches differ in several ways due to differences in language philosophy, syntax, and runtime behavior.

While Java enforces a strict, structured object-oriented approach suitable for large-scale enterprise applications, Python provides a more flexible and dynamic object-oriented model that is easier for rapid development and prototyping (for smaller applications). The choice between the two often depends on the application's requirements and the programmer’s preference.


| **Aspect**                 | **Java**                                                  | **Python**                                              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language Paradigm**      | Purely object-oriented (everything is a class or belongs to a class). | Multi-paradigm: supports OOP, procedural, and functional programming. |
| **Class Declaration**      | Requires explicit type declaration and strict structure. | Dynamic and flexible; no type declarations are needed. |
| **Object Instantiation**   | Requires `new` keyword to create objects.                | No `new` keyword; objects are created directly by calling the class name. |
| **Static Typing**          | Strongly typed, with compile-time type checking.         | Dynamically typed; types are checked at runtime.        |
| **Access Modifiers**       | Supports access modifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected` for encapsulation. | No explicit access modifiers; privacy is by convention (e.g., `_var` for protected, `__var` for private). |
| **Method Overloading**     | Supports method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). | No method overloading; default arguments can simulate overloading. |
| **Method Overriding**      | Must use the `@Override` annotation to override methods of a parent class. | Simply redefine the method in the child class to override it. |
| **Inheritance**            | Single inheritance with optional `implements` for interfaces. | Supports multiple inheritance natively using classes. |
| **Abstract Classes**       | Requires the `abstract` keyword for abstract classes and methods. | Uses the `abc` module to define abstract base classes and methods. |
| **Interfaces**             | Separate construct for defining method-only contracts (e.g., `interface`). | Interfaces are implemented using abstract base classes (ABCs). |
| **Polymorphism**           | Strict compile-time polymorphism with method signatures. | Dynamic and runtime polymorphism due to duck typing. |
| **Memory Management**      | Garbage collection is managed by the JVM.                | Garbage collection is managed by Python’s interpreter using reference counting and cycles. |
| **Constructors**           | Explicit constructors using the class name.             | Unified constructor method: `__init__`.               |
| **Everything is an Object**| Not everything is an object (e.g., `int` is a primitive). | Everything in Python, including numbers and functions, is an object. |
| **Static Methods**         | Declared using `static` keyword.                         | Declared using the `@staticmethod` decorator.         |
| **Properties**             | Explicit getter/setter methods are common.              | Simplified with `@property` decorator for attribute access. |
| **Runtime Behavior**       | Runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).                 | Runs on Python's interpreter or runtime environment.  |

### **Detailed Key Differences**

1. **Typing System**:
    - **Java**: Strongly and statically typed; every variable and method must have a declared type.
    - **Python**: Dynamically typed; the type of a variable is inferred at runtime.

2. **Access Control**:
    - **Java**: Uses keywords like `private`, `protected`, and `public` for encapsulation.
    - **Python**: Does not have strict access modifiers; instead, underscores (`_` or `__`) are used by convention to signal the intended level of access.

3. **Inheritance**:
    - **Java**: Only supports single inheritance but allows multiple inheritance through interfaces.
    - **Python**: Directly supports multiple inheritance via classes.

4. **Constructors**:
    - **Java**: Constructor name matches the class name, and there can be multiple constructors with different signatures.
    - **Python**: Uses the unified `__init__` method as the constructor; no overloading is directly supported.

5. **Polymorphism**:
    - **Java**: Requires compile-time method signatures and explicit overriding rules.
    - **Python**: Uses dynamic typing for polymorphism, relying on "duck typing" (if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck).

6. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**:
    - **Java**: Separates abstract classes and interfaces; abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses.
    - **Python**: Merges the concepts using the `abc` module for defining abstract base classes.

7. **Properties**:
    - **Java**: Typically uses explicit getter and setter methods.
    - **Python**: Simplifies access using the `@property` decorator, allowing methods to be accessed as attributes.

8. **Everything is an Object**:
    - **Java**: Has primitives like `int` and `double` that are not objects (though they have wrapper classes like `Integer` and `Double`).
    - **Python**: Everything, including numbers and functions, is an object.




### Inheritance

**Inheritance** in Python allows a class (called a **child class**) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a **parent class** or **superclass**). This promotes **code reusability** and the ability to build upon existing functionality. The child class can inherit, override, or extend the functionality of the parent class.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Parent Class (Superclass)**: The class being inherited from.
- **Child Class (Subclass)**: The class that inherits from the parent class.

#### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal speaks"

class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        return "Dog barks"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.speak())  # Inherited method from Animal class
print(dog.bark())   # Method from Dog class
```

In this example, the `Dog` class inherits the `speak()` method from the `Animal` class while defining its own `bark()` method.

### Magic functions

**Magic functions** (also known as **dunder methods** or **special methods**) in Python are built-in methods that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names, like `__init__` or `__str__`. These methods allow developers to define behaviors for instances of user-defined classes in Python. They are automatically invoked by Python for certain operations, enabling customization of standard Python behavior such as initialization, representation, comparison, and more.

#### Common Magic Functions:
1. **`__init__(self)`**:
- Initializes a new object instance.
- Called when a new instance of a class is created (constructor).
- Example:
  ```python
  class Person:
      def __init__(self, name):
          self.name = name
  ```

2. **`__str__(self)`**:
- Returns a string representation of the object.
- Called when `str()` or `print()` is used on an object.
- Example:
  ```python
  def __str__(self):
      return f"Person: {self.name}"
  ```

3. **`__repr__(self)`**:
- Returns a formal string representation of the object.
- Often used for debugging and called by `repr()`.
- Example:
  ```python
  def __repr__(self):
      return f"Person({self.name!r})"
  ```

4. **`__len__(self)`**:
- Returns the length of the object (e.g., when `len()` is called).
- Example:
  ```python
  def __len__(self):
      return len(self.name)
  ```

5. **`__getitem__(self, key)`**:
- Allows objects to be indexed like lists or dictionaries.
- Example:
  ```python
  def __getitem__(self, index):
      return self.data[index]
  ```

6. **`__add__(self, other)`**:
- Defines the behavior for the `+` operator.
- Example:
  ```python
  def __add__(self, other):
      return self.value + other.value
  ```

7. **`__eq__(self, other)`**:
- Defines the behavior for the `==` operator (equality).
- Example:
  ```python
  def __eq__(self, other):
      return self.name == other.name
  ```

#### Purpose:
Magic functions help in customizing Python class behavior for operators, built-in functions, and type casting. They allow developers to define **object-oriented** behavior that integrates naturally with Python's syntax.

More information on magic methods can be found in the [Guide to Python's Magic Methods](https://github.com/RafeKettler/magicmethods/blob/master/magicmethods.pdf).

### Private variables

In Python, **private variables** are variables that are intended to be **hidden** from outside access, meaning they should only be accessible within the class they are defined in. While Python doesn’t have strict access modifiers like some other languages (e.g., `private` in Java or C++), it provides a convention for creating private variables.

#### How to Define a Private Variable:
In Python, private variables are denoted by **prefixing their name with two underscores (`__`)**. This triggers name mangling, which changes the variable name internally to prevent direct access from outside the class.

#### Example:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name        # Public variable
        self.__age = age        # Private variable

    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age       # Accessing private variable from within the class

# Creating an instance of Person
person = Person("John", 30)

print(person.name)     # Works fine (public)
print(person.get_age())  # Accessing private variable through a method
print(person.__age)    # Raises AttributeError (private)
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Name Mangling**: Python internally changes the name of a private variable. For example, `__age` becomes `_Person__age`. This is done to make it harder (but not impossible) to access private variables from outside the class.

2. **Accessing Private Variables**: Though Python doesn’t enforce strict privacy, you can still access private variables through name mangling:
   ```python
   print(person._Person__age)  # This works but is not recommended
   ```

3. **Private vs. Public**:
- **Public variables** (without the underscore prefix) are accessible from outside the class.
- **Private variables** (with a `__` prefix) are intended to be accessed only within the class.

#### Purpose of Private Variables:
- **Encapsulation**: Helps in controlling how certain data is accessed or modified.
- **Data Protection**: Limits access to sensitive data, ensuring it’s only modified or accessed in controlled ways.

While Python doesn't have strict access control like other languages, the use of private variables is a convention to **signal intent** about how class attributes should be used.

### Difference Between Class and Object Variables

In Python, **class variables** and **object (instance) variables** are both attributes that belong to a class, but they have distinct behaviors and uses:

#### 1. **Class Variables** (or Static Variables):
- **Shared Across All Instances**: Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any method.
- **Accessed Using the Class Name**: Class variables are typically accessed using the class name, although they can also be accessed through instances.
- **Same Value for All Instances**: Any changes to a class variable affect all instances of the class, because the variable is shared across them.

##### Example of a Class Variable:
```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color  # Instance variable

# All cars have 4 wheels, shared by all instances
car1 = Car("Red")
car2 = Car("Blue")

print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 4
print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 4

Car.wheels = 6  # Changing the class variable affects all instances
print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 6
print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 6
```

#### 2. **Object (Instance) Variables**:
- **Unique to Each Instance**: Object (or instance) variables are attributes that belong to each specific object instance. They are defined within the `__init__()` method (or other instance methods) using `self`.
- **Accessed Using the Instance**: Instance variables are accessed through the specific instance of the class and hold data that is unique to that instance.
- **Different Values for Each Instance**: Each object instance can have its own unique values for instance variables, unlike class variables which are shared.

##### Example of an Object (Instance) Variable:
```python
class Car:
    wheels = 4  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color  # Instance variable

car1 = Car("Red")
car2 = Car("Blue")

print(car1.color)  # Output: Red
print(car2.color)  # Output: Blue

# Changing car1's color does not affect car2
car1.color = "Green"
print(car1.color)  # Output: Green
print(car2.color)  # Output: Blue
```

#### Key Differences:

| **Feature**           | **Class Variables**                     | **Object (Instance) Variables**            |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Defined**           | Outside any method, at the class level  | Inside methods, typically `__init__()`     |
| **Access**            | Accessed via class or instance          | Accessed via instances (`self.variable`)   |
| **Shared or Unique**  | Shared across all instances             | Unique to each instance                    |
| **Scope**             | Class-wide scope (same for all objects) | Object-specific scope (each object has its own) |
| **Modification**      | Modifying it affects all instances      | Modifying it affects only the specific instance |
| **Example Use**       | Constants or values that are the same for all instances (e.g., number of wheels in a car class) | Attributes that vary between instances (e.g., color of a car) |

#### Summary:
- **Class variables** are shared across all instances of the class and are used for data that remains the same for all objects.
- **Object variables** (instance variables) are specific to each instance and are used for data that can differ between objects.
